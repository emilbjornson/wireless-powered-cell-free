## Abstract of Article

This paper considers wireless uplink information
and downlink power transfer in cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output systems. The single-antenna user equipments
(UEs) utilize the energy harvested in the downlink to transmit
uplink pilot and information signals to the multiple-antenna
access points (APs). We consider Rician fading and maximum
ratio processing based on either linear minimum mean-squared
error (LMMSE) or least-squares (LS) channel estimation. We
derive the average harvested energy by using a practical nonlinear
energy harvesting circuit model for both coherent and noncoherent
transmission schemes. Furthermore, the uplink spectral
efficiency (SE) is derived for all the considered methods and
the max-min fairness problem is cast where the optimization
variables are the AP and UE power control coefficients together
with the large-scale fading decoding vectors. The objective is to
maximize the minimum SE of the UEs’ under APs’ and UEs’
transmission power constraints. A novel alternating optimization
algorithm with guaranteed convergence and improvement at each
step is proposed to solve the highly-coupled non-convex problem.

## Content of Code Package

The article contains 12 simulation figures, numbered 2-13. Figures 2 and 3 are generated by the Matlab script Fig2_3.m. Figures 4, 5, 12, and 13 are generated by the Matlab script Fig4_5_12_13.m. Figures 6 and 7 are generated by the Matlab script Fig6_7.m. Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 are generated respectively by the Matlab scripts Fig8.m, Fig9.m, Fig10.m, and Fig11.m. The package also contains the Matlab scripts functionExampleSetup.m, functionExpectations_lmmse.m, functionExpectations_lmmse_random_pilot_sequence.m, functionExpectations_ls.m, optimize_power_coh_lin.m, optimize_power_coh_nonlin.m, optimize_power_noncoh_lin.m, and optimize_power_noncoh_nonlin.m that are MATLAB functions used by some of the scripts.

For the optimization problems, the convex programming solver CVX http://cvxr.com/cvx/ is used. Please adjust the default solver of CVX to SDPT3 not to encounter any issues. The version we have tested was SDPT3 4.0.
